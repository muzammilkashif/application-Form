     <p id="pare" > 
I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and faith. 
My name is muzammil, and I am currently a student of [web development or Degree Name, e.g., BS Computer Science / Saylani IT Program / Freelancing].
 I belong to a financially weak background and cannot afford a personal laptop, which is essential for continuing my studies and practicing my skills.

Saylani has always been a source of great support for deserving individuals like me.
 I humbly request you to kindly provide me with a laptop so that I can continue my learning effectively and work towards building a better future for myself and my family.

     </p>
